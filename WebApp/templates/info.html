        Nums2Money is a project aimed at helping the user have a better understanding of the stock exchange market and the factors that affect the rise and fall of stock prices.

We are using information from Twitter to help give advice on whether it is advisable to invest in a companyâ€™s stock or not.

It will show the percentage of positive, neutral, and negative tweets about the company and present the user with the information in a visualization.

This is not intended to be a stock market predictor and the decision of the user to invest in stocks should not be based solely on the recommendations from this project.
